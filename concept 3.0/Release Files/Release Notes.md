## Overview

<img src="Design/Final Design (stylized).png" width="960">

Natron UI 3.0 is a completely redesigned version of Natron's UI, made from scratch. Based on previous feedback, I've made many changes to the UI. A summary of these changes is listed below.

## Notable Improvments

* Node UI improvements, including a less cluttered design for nodes

* Expandable menus replace tabs in properties panel, which better establish visual hierarchy

* Tabbed interface from Natron's existing UI is kept

* Properties panel has a cleaner, albeit still compact, design

* Viewport panel controls are more spaced out and easier to find

* Viewport is larger and better optimized for professionals, with integration of all of Natron's viewport settings

## Fixes

* Menu bar is no longer hidden by default anymore

* Natron's side bar is kept with original icons instead of unfamiliar icons of the previous release

* Control sliders are added back

* Icons replaced with Material Design Icons, which look more professional

* Information density 

* Sliders have input boxes and clickable buttons

* Padding issues solved

* Removal of bloated and useless features, such as the "add node" menu

## Website Redesign

Alongside the redesign of Natron's GUI, I also created a redesign of its website. Although it's far from production-ready yet, you're welcome to try it out:

## Future

* I will continue to ask for the coummunity's opinions and commentary

* I might implement different themes in the future

* If the design is approved by a large portion of the community, I will work toward a Qt demo of my design

* I will use QML to recreate this design in Qt

* I will work directly on implementing this design into Natron's source code if the Qt mockup is successful
