# Final Designs

These files are in SVG format and were created using the free and open-source software Inkscape. To use this file, open it in Inkscape; I cannot guarantee that it would load properly into Illustrator, GIMP, Affinity Designer or other vector graphics software.

* The `src` folder contains the original SVGs that were created in Inkscape, and are ready for editing

* The `dist` folder contains optimized SVGs with a lower file size but may be less suited for editing

All files in this folder are under a CC0 license ('no rights reserved'). Use them, build on them, and fork them freely!
