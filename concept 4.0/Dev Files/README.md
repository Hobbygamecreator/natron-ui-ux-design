# Development Files of Natron 4.0

Developing UI mockups with Inkscape is a chaotic process. So chaotic, that I didn't have time to implement proper naming conventions for most of my designs. Consequently, my development files are a total mess.

That's why I've tried to clear things up a bit. There are too many links to files here that renaming is a bad idea. So I've mapped out the function of each file, its purposes, and its stage in the overall design process. Now, just get to the file you want with this document.

Can this fully solve the issue of development hell? No, but that's fine. At least the files can rest in peace here, and I don't have to implement some crazy naming scheme. If you're looking for a file from the Natron UI/UX project, try looking for it here.

## Folders

The **mockups** folder is used for publishing completed designs. Completed designs are ones that won't be further modified. It could be thought of as a gallery of the development files. If you're trying to see how the designs have progressed, this is the right place to look.

The **prototypes** folder is used for publishing completed designs that have animations. This includes .alva files for Alva (which may be removed in the future) that were used for the first stage of prototyping. Also here are the videos showing animations for the website design. If you're looking for designs with UI animations, you're in the right place

The **UI Reference** folder is used for collecting and storing reference images. Due to restrictions in working overseas, I don't always have an internet connection, so I can't always use Dribbble or Deviantart to look up UIconcepts. Instead, I've downloaded most of my UI references to use offline. For more information, see [here](UI%20Reference/README.md).

The **Web-optimized-images** section is for storing all images that I'll publish onto the Natron community forum. For faster loadspeeds, I've converted PNG mockups into smaller and more compact JPEGs. Most of the images that I've posted on the Natron forum will be in this folder. 

Lastly, there are SVG design files in this folder as well. See the next section for more details about them.

## Design Files

Firstly, there are two main categories of design files. The first category is for the *website design*, while the second category is only for the Natron Desktop GUI.
