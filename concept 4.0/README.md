# Natron UI 4.0 Project

A improved, free and open-source design of Natron's UI, with a modern interface that is: 

* distractionless and hassle-free to use 

* easy to learn and understand

* customizable and themable

Currently, the main focus of this design is the original Anima Design System for Natron. View the prototype components [here](Dev%20Files/Artboard.svg).

## Contribution Guide

This project is going to be a massive, time-consuming undertaking, and I will never be able to finish it alone. I ask for anyone who uses Natron, and supports free and open-source, to contribute to this open-source design.

Some guidelines on contributions:

* Please only share `.alva`, SVG or Inkscape SVG files, not files in a proprietary format, like Adobe XD or Sketch

* Please stick to open-source fonts, such as Inter, Open Sans or Helvetica

* Everyone's work will be under the terms of the MIT license

* Be respectful of each others' work

* Anyone can contribute to this project

For an extensive guide to contribution, please visit the [Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Key Issues to Solve

* The Material Design System must be scrapped and replaced by a new design system (with *exceptions\**)

* Excessive padding must be reduced

* UI elements must be made more compact

* Sliders must be changed to logarithmic and start in the center, with support for fine adjustments

* Tabs from the previous design must be given a redesign, to make them less distracting and obstrusive

**\* Material Design icons will be kept and will continue to be used as the primary icon set**

## Overview

* Create a new design system inspired by the UI elements of [Blender](https://blender.org), [Fusion](), [Adobe's Spectrum Design System](https://spectrum.adobe.com/) and [Nuke]()

	* Recreate all the design components of each software (e.g. buttons, sliders, tabs) using Inkscape
	
	* Gather references of variations of the design components
	
	* Create a new design component based on the references and the design components of Blender, Fusion and Nuke
	
	* Put the finished design system into the style guide

* *After* finishing the design system, use the new design system for creating the UI mockup

	* Create a wireframe for the mockup that follows Natron's current UI
	
	* Fill in the wireframe with components from the design system
	
	* Adjust the position and location of each components as required

* Check the design and ensure compatibility with Natron's existing UI

* Conduct user testing with surveys on Typeform


## Requirements

* The new design must not break compatibility with Natron's existing UI *or* Nuke's UI

* The new design must be themable and support both light and dark themes	

* Relative sizes of panels must be kept the same with Natron's original

* UI elements must support rearranging and minimizing
