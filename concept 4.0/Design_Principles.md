# Design Principles

Fundamental design guidelines followed by the Natron UI redesign project.

## Design Ethos

*Designs should focus on making software more accessible*

Good software isn't just about lots of features and powerful tools; it should also make you enjoy using it. No one wants to use (or learn) software if it isn't user-friendly. **Making software look less intimidating, especially to new users, is the primary goal.**

*Designs should be clean and unobtrusive*

We don't want to add anything that breaks familiar design metaphors. We also don't want to make a completely new UI from scratch, which would confuse users used to the existing UI.

*Designs should be adaptable and customizable*

We want make our designs a stable foundation on which other designers can build on. That means support for themes, tweaks and custom workspaces out of the box. 

## Design Goals

* Create a modern layout

* Create cleaner, less cluttered controls

* Retain familiarity to Nuke as much as possible

* Original design without entirely discarding the existing UI
