# Project Documentation

This page will one day cover all the design systems, concepts, and components that will be part of the Natron UI/UX Redesign. I hope to make it as comprehensive as Google's [Material Design Documentation].


Unfortunately, we're not there yet. So here's a preview of things I hope to implement:

- Documentation website
  - Use mdBook and its navy theme (personal aesthetic choice)
  - Ship site static site for fast loading
  - Remove dependency on analytics and badge for no telemetry
- Full Anima design system
  - Design philosophy
  - Standardized components shared across web/desktop
  - Specs of design/copy and paste code
  - Example usage
  - Theming examples
  - Motion/UI Animation examples
  - High-quality downloadable component libraries (SVG + HTML)
  - Integration of design with open formats (SVG + HTML/SCSS + Qt + Natron Mograph Comp)
- Outreach
  - Connect to Natron's website
  - Update GitHub repository to FOSS standards
  - Use Open Collective for funding maintainers and developers
